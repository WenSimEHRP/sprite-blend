# Sprite blender

A program to blend two indexed (real)sprites and outputs one realsprite along with two recoloursprites for use with NML.\
Only useful if you want to save a few kilobytes, or have a very special code setup.

```bash
py ./blend.py <path to file 1> <path to file 2> <path to file 3> <...>
```

You can also use `blend_recolour_sprites.py` to blend two recolour index sets.

An additional GUI program `blend_ui.py` is under development. It's very messy, and don't expect it to work.
